## About

Replicating SCAN algorithm described in Google Deep Mind's paper ["SCAN: Learning Abstract Hierarchical Compositional Visual Concepts"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03389)



Image datasets are created with [Rodent envrironment. ](https://github.com/miyosuda/rodent/tree/master/examples/04_texture_replace)

## Requirements

- Tensorflow 1.2 or later
- Python2 or 3


## How to train
